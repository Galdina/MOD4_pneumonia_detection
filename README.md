## Introduction  
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid.
With pneumonia, the air sacs may fill with fluid or pus. The infection can be life-threatening to anyone, but particularly to infants, children, and people over 65.
Symptoms include cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.
Antibiotics can treat many forms of pneumonia. Some forms of pneumonia can be prevented by vaccines.
The WHO estimates that over 4 million premature deaths occur annually from household air pollution-related diseases including pneumonia. Over 150 million people get infected with pneumonia on an annual basis especially children under 5 years old.
